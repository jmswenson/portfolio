- **Architecture:** Multi-modal RAG system: web scraping ‚Üí data processing ‚Üí LLM-powered Q&A generation ‚Üí vector embeddings ‚Üí semantic search API ‚Üí responsive frontend
- **Technologies:** Python, Selenium, Pinecone Vector DB, Vue.js, LLM integration (Gemini), semantic search, REST APIs
- **Collaboration:** Co-developed with technical collaborator who enhanced scraping capabilities and provided frontend foundation; leveraged AI coding agents to build sophisticated Vue.js interface despite limited frontend experience
- **Data Engineering:** Engineered comprehensive ETL pipeline including automated image processing pipeline, LLM-powered Q&A generation workflow, and quality control systems supporting production deployment with 1000+ searchable question-answer pairs
- **Innovation:** Built captioning system using multi-prompt AI captioning with temporal context injection, processing photos to generate empathetic descriptions; implemented semantic photo-answer matching enabling multi-modal retrieval across text and visual content
- **Impact:** Deployed production system enabling semantic search of childhood cancer experiences. Live at [adas-spark.org/adas-living-story](https://adas-spark.org/adas-living-story)
- **Repository:** [Adas-Spark/code](https://github.com/Adas-Spark/code)

### Breast Cancer Classification Challenge
**Binary Classification Model for Medical Diagnosis**
- **Problem:** Predict whether biopsied breast tumors are benign or malignant using the Wisconsin Breast Cancer dataset
- **Approach:** Comprehensive ML pipeline with data cleaning, feature engineering, hyperparameter optimization, and model comparison
- **Models Evaluated:** Logistic Regression, Random Forest with full hyperparameter search and feature selection
- **Key Results:** Achieved 98% recall for malignant classification using optimized Random Forest
- **Technologies:** Python, scikit-learn, pandas, KNN imputation, cross-validation
- **Code:** `Joel_Swenson_breast_cancer.html` (complete analysis with detailed methodology)

### Flow Cytometry Cancer Cell Detection
**Unsupervised ML for Automated Cancer Cell Identification**
- **Challenge:** Automate identification of cancer cells in flow cytometry data to scale personalized medicine
- **Innovation:** Combined t-SNE dimensionality reduction with DBSCAN clustering to overcome limitations of traditional methods
- **Impact:** Replaced manual expert analysis bottleneck, enabling company to help more patients
- **Technologies:** Python, t-SNE, DBSCAN, PCA, scikit-learn, data visualization
- **Full Details:** [Blog Post](https://jmswenson.github.io/flow.html) with complete methodology and results

### Gmail-Calendar Integration Automation
**Personal Productivity Tool with API Integration**
- **Problem:** Manual calendar event creation from recurring family emails was time-consuming and error-prone
- **Solution:** Automated script that fetches emails via Gmail API, parses event details, and creates calendar events for multiple attendees
- **Technologies:** Python, Google APIs (Gmail & Calendar), OAuth 2.0, CLI interface, regex parsing
- **Impact:** Saves time and ensures accurate family scheduling
- **Code:** `Joel_Swenson_gmail-gcal-interface-cli.py`
